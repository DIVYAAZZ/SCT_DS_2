Data cleaning and exploratory data analysis
--This project performs data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the famous Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to understand the data better, clean missing or irrelevant information, and visualize meaningful patterns related to survival rates.

--âœ… Key Steps
Data Cleaning:

Filled missing values in the Age column using the median.

Dropped the Cabin column due to excessive missing data.

Replaced missing values in the Embarked column with the most frequent port.

--Visualizations:

Survival Count â€“ Shows the overall number of survivors and non-survivors.

Survival by Gender â€“ Highlights the survival rate differences between male and female passengers.

Survival by Passenger Class â€“ Explores how travel class impacted survival chances.

Age Distribution by Survival â€“ Illustrates age patterns among those who survived and did not.

--ðŸ“Š Tools & Libraries Used
pandas â€“ For data manipulation and cleaning

seaborn â€“ For creating informative plots

matplotlib â€“ For layout and plot customization
